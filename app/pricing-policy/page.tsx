              All prices displayed on our website are inclusive of applicable taxes and are clearly marked in Indian Rupees (INR).

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Our pricing structure is based on several factors including tea grade, harvest season, processing methods, and rarity of the blend. Premium first flush and second flush teas command higher prices due to their exceptional quality, limited availability, and the meticulous care taken during cultivation and processing in the pristine Darjeeling hills.

Corporate clients, retailers, and tea enthusiasts looking to purchase larger quantities can benefit from our wholesale pricing structure.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Given the seasonal nature of tea production in Darjeeling, prices may vary based on harvest availability and market conditions. We strive to maintain stable pricing throughout the year while ensuring fair compensation to our tea garden partners and maintaining the highest quality standards for our customers.
